### INTRODUCTION: <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to DocuWorks Github Repository. The goal of this project is to build a real-time word editor which would enable users across different devices to work on the same
document at one time. The application utilizes ReactJS for handling client-side activities and NodeJS for handling server-side activities. Data is stored and accessed using MongoDB.

### IMPORTANT NOTE: <a name="important-note"></a>


a. This part of the repository consists of only the client side of the application. You can access the server from [here](https://github.com/jayanthkodurkumar/Docuworks-Client).

b. You need both the server and the client versions to run the application as intended.

c. The app is not hosted. Please run it locally.

### SETTING UP MongoDB CLUSTER AND DATABASE:<a name="mongodb-cluster"></a>

1. Make sure to create an account on MongoDB and create a cluster. 
2. Once creating a cluster, create a database named 'docs' and a collection named 'docs'.
3. You can install the MongoDB compass application to connect to your cluster and work on databases from your machine.
